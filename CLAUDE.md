### Technical Specialties
- **cocos-ui-builder**: UI/UX implementation
- **cocos-multiplayer-architect**: Networking and multiplayer
- **cocos-performance-optimizer**: General performance optimization
- **cocos-mobile-optimizer**: Mobile-specific optimization

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
1. **TypeScript First**: Always use TypeScript for Cocos Creator 3.x projects
2. **Component-Based**: Follow component-based architecture
3. **Performance Aware**: Consider mobile performance in all implementations
4. **Type Safety**: Use proper TypeScript types and decorators

### Common Patterns

#### Component Structure
```typescript
import { _decorator, Component, Node } from 'cc';
const { ccclass, property } = _decorator;

@ccclass('ComponentName')
export class ComponentName extends Component {
    @property(Node)
    targetNode: Node = null;
    
    @property
    speed: number = 100;
    
    start() {
        // Initialization
    }
    
    update(deltaTime: number) {
        // Frame updates
    }
}
```

#### Resource Loading
```typescript
resources.load('path/to/asset', AssetType, (err, asset) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error(err);
        return;
    }
    // Use asset
});
```

### Performance Best Practices
1. Use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
2. Batch draw calls with sprite atlases
3. Optimize texture sizes for mobile
4. Implement LOD for 3D games
5. Profile regularly with Chrome DevTools

## Workflow

### New Project Setup
1. Use `cocos-project-architect` for initial architecture
2. Configure team with `cocos-team-coordinator`
3. Implement core systems with specialized agents
4. Optimize with performance agents

### Problem Solving
1. Identify the problem domain
2. Select appropriate specialist agent
3. Implement solution following agent guidance
4. Review with `code-reviewer` if needed

### Common Tasks

#### Creating a New Component
- Use `cocos-component-architect` for design
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Implement proper lifecycle methods

#### Performance Issues
- Start with `cocos-performance-optimizer`
- Use `cocos-mobile-optimizer` for mobile
- Profile and measure improvements

#### UI Implementation
- Use `cocos-ui-builder` for layouts
- Follow responsive design principles
- Test on multiple resolutions

## Platform Considerations

### Mobile (iOS/Android)
- Texture compression (ETC1/2, PVRTC)
- Touch input optimization
- Battery usage considerations
- App size optimization

### Web (HTML5)
- Initial loading optimization
- WebGL compatibility
- Browser performance variations
- Network asset loading

### Desktop
- Higher performance targets
- Keyboard/mouse input
- Larger texture budgets
- Window resizing support

```

### Common Issues
1. **Draw Calls**: Use sprite atlases and batching
2. **Memory Leaks**: Properly destroy nodes and clear references
3. **Loading Times**: Implement progressive loading
4. **Frame Drops**: Profile and optimize bottlenecks

## Testing and Debugging

1. Use Cocos Creator Profiler
2. Chrome DevTools for web builds
3. Platform-specific profilers (Xcode, Android Studio)
4. Implement debug UI for development builds

Remember: Always consider the target platform and performance implications of your implementations. Use the specialized agents to ensure best practices are followed throughout development.
