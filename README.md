## üöÄ Quick Start (3 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- **Claude Code CLI** installed and authenticated
- **Claude subscription** - recommended for intensive agent workflows
- Active Cocos Creator project directory

### 1. Install the Agents
```bash
git clone https://github.com/The1Studio/the1-cocos-claude-agent.git
```

#### Option A: Symlink (Recommended - auto-updates)

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
ln -sf "$(pwd)/the1-cocos-claude-agent" ~/.claude/the1-cocos-claude-agent
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
cmd /c mklink /D "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\the1-cocos-claude-agent" "$(Get-Location)\the1-cocos-claude-agent"
```

#### Option B: Copy (Static - no auto-updates)
```bash
cp -r the1-cocos-claude-agent ~/.claude/
```

### 2. Verify Installation
```bash
claude /agents
# Should show all 21 Cocos Creator agents
```

### 3. Initialize Your Cocos Project
**Navigate** to your **Cocos Creator project directory** and run:

```bash
claude "use @cocos-team-coordinator and set up the optimal AI team for my Cocos Creator project"
```

### 4. Start Building
```bash
# For playable ads
claude "use @cocos-playable-architect and create a match-3 playable ad structure"

# For mobile games
claude "use @cocos-project-architect and design a casual puzzle game architecture"

# For optimization
claude "use @cocos-performance-optimizer and improve my game's performance"
```

Your AI team will automatically detect your Cocos version and select the right specialists!

## üéØ How It Works

The Cocos Creator agents work together seamlessly:

1. **Project Analysis** - `cocos-team-coordinator` detects your Cocos version, project type, and target platforms
2. **Architecture Planning** - `cocos-project-architect` designs the overall system structure  
3. **Specialized Implementation** - Domain experts handle specific areas (playable ads, UI, performance)
4. **Quality Assurance** - Built-in optimization and best practices enforcement

### Example Workflows

**Creating a Playable Ad:**
```bash
claude "use @cocos-rapid-prototyper and create a quick match-3 playable prototype"
claude "use @cocos-tutorial-designer and add an engaging tutorial flow"  
claude "use @cocos-playable-optimizer and reduce size to under 3MB"
claude "use @cocos-conversion-optimizer and maximize install rates"
```

**Building a Mobile Game:**
```bash
claude "use @cocos-casual-game-expert and implement core gameplay mechanics"
claude "use @cocos-ui-builder and create responsive UI for multiple screen sizes"
claude "use @cocos-mobile-optimizer and optimize for low-end Android devices"
```
