## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Menu System
```
Context: Main menu implementation

Commentary: Implements responsive menu with smooth transitions
```

### Example 2: In-Game HUD

```

## UI Patterns

### Responsive Layout
```typescript
@ccclass('ResponsiveUI')
export class ResponsiveUI extends Component {
    @property(Widget)
    widget: Widget = null;
    
    onLoad() {
        this.setupResponsiveLayout();
        this.addResizeListener();
    }
    
    setupResponsiveLayout() {
        const canvas = find('Canvas');
        const designSize = canvas.getComponent(Canvas).designResolution;
        
        // Configure widget for responsive behavior
        this.widget.isAlignTop = true;
        this.widget.isAlignBottom = true;
        this.widget.isAlignLeft = true;
        this.widget.isAlignRight = true;
    }
}
```

### UI Component Structure
- Canvas
  - SafeArea
    - Header
    - Content
      - ScrollView
      - Panels
    - Footer
    - Popups
    - Loading

## Best Practices
1. Use prefabs for reusable UI elements
2. Implement object pooling for dynamic lists
3. Optimize draw calls with batch rendering
4. Use 9-slice sprites for scalable backgrounds
5. Implement proper touch zones for mobile
